HOW TO UPGRADE PLUGINS
Follow these steps to upgrade or update a plugin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) LOCATE PLUGINS FOLDER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first step is to locate your [cmsAdmin] folder.  This is the folder on
your website where you originally installed the CMS software.  There will
be a folder under this called /plugins/.  This is your plugins folder.


2) BACKUP PLUGINS FOLDER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download a backup copy of the /plugins/ folder and any files or folders in it.


3) CHECK REQUIRED CMS VERSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check the "Requires at least" line at the top of the plugin.  This is the
CMS version that the plugin requires.  Make sure you have this version before
upgrading as the plugin can't be activated and may generate errors if the
CMS version is lower than the version required.


4) REVIEW PLUGIN INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review the readme.txt file that came with the plugin before continuing for
further instructions.


5) COPY USER CONFIGURABLE SETTINGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some plugins have use configurable settings that can be modified at the top of
the plugin file.  Check for these and copy any custom settings that you've
previously entered over to the new plugin file.


6) UPLOAD PLUGIN FILE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upload the new plugin file.  If the new plugin has the same filename as the old
one just upload it over top of the old one.


7) TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need help please refer to the plugin readme file or contact support for
assistance.
