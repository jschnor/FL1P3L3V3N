license confers no title or ownership in the Software and is not a sale of
any rights in the Software.</p>

<p>6. <b>3RD PARTY SERVICES</b> This Software may make use of, or have the

and information about the software installed (Program ID, Version, Install URL,
Install Path, Checksum).  No other information is sent.</p>

<p>8. <b>UPGRADES. </b> If this copy of the software is an upgrade from an
earlier version of the software, it is provided to You on a license exchange
basis.  Your use of the Software upgrade is subject to the terms of this

to voluntarily terminate Your earlier license and that You will not continue to
use the earlier version of the Software or transfer it to another person or
entity.</p>

<li> You destroy any other copies of the Software and generated content (if applicable) in Your possession.</li>

<li> The legal jurisdiction for the sublicense is defined as either that of the Vendor or
 that of Your corporate head office.</li>
<li> You do not make any representations or warranties on behalf of Vendor.</li>

<li> You agree to enforce the terms of any sublicense that You are authorized to make.

<p>10. <b>SUBLICENSING.</b> You may not sublicense the Software or your rights under

<?php endif; ?>


<p>11. <b>TERMINATION.</b> Vendor may terminate Your license if You do not abide
by the license terms or if You have not paid applicable license fees.
Termination of the license may include, but not be limited to, marking the
Product ID as invalid to prevent further installations or usage. Upon
termination of license, You shall immediately discontinue the use of the
Software and shall within ten (10) days return to Vendor all copies of the
Software or confirm that You have destroyed all copies of it. <b>Your
obligations to pay accrued charges and fees, if any, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.</b> Vendor's third party licensors may protect
their rights in the event of any violation of the terms and conditions of this
license. You agree to indemnify Vendor and its licensors for reasonable attorney
fees in enforcing its rights pursuant to this license.</p>

<p>12. <b>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b> The Software is provided on an "AS IS"
basis, without warranty of any kind, including, without limitation, the
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-
infringement. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Software
is borne by You. Should the Software prove defective, You, not Vendor or its
licensors, assume the entire cost of any service and repair. If the Software is
intended to link to, extract content from or otherwise integrate with a third
party service, Vendor makes no representation or warranty that Your particular
use of the Software is or will continue to be authorized by law in Your
jurisdiction or that the third party service will continue to be available to
You. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of the agreement.</p>

<p>13. <b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL VENDOR OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE
TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
FOR WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE,
DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE OR ECONOMIC LOSSES. IN NO EVENT WILL VENDOR OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT PAID TO LICENSE THE
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY SHALL HAVE INFORMED VENDOR OR ITS
LICENSORS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM. NO CLAIM,
REGARDLESS OF FORM, MAY BE MADE OR ACTION BROUGHT BY YOU MORE THAN ONE YEAR
AFTER THE BASIS FOR THE CLAIM BECOMES KNOWN TO THE PARTY ASSERTING IT.</b></p>

<p>14. <b>APPLICABLE LAW.</b> This license shall be interpreted in accordance
with the laws of <?php echo $SETTINGS['vendorLocation']; ?>. Any disputes arising out of this license
shall be adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction in <?php echo $SETTINGS['vendorLocation']; ?>.</p>

<p>15. <b>GOVERNING LANGUAGE.</b> Any translation of this License is done for
local requirements and in the event of a dispute between the English and any
non-English versions, the English version of this License shall govern.</p>

<p>16. <b>ENTIRE AGREEMENT.</b> This license constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties relating to the Software and supersedes any proposal or
prior agreement, oral or written, and any other communication relating to the
subject matter of this license. Any conflict between the terms of this License
Agreement and any Purchase Order, invoice, or representation shall be resolved
in favour of the terms of this License Agreement. In the event that any clause
or portion of any such clause is declared invalid for any reason, such finding
shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining portions of this License
and the unenforceable clause shall be severed from this license. <b>Any
amendment to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.</b></p>
