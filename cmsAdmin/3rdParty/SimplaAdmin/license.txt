Extended License

The Extended License grants you, the Purchaser, a non-exclusive, non-
transferrable right to make use of the Product you acquire.

Your use of the Product, under the Extended License, is subject to the following
conditions:

(a) You may use the Product alone or you may incorporate the Product into
another work you are creating.

(b) Unless you have our prior written consent, you must not directly or
indirectly license, sub-license, sell or resell the Product or offer to do any
of these things unless the Product is incorporated into a work you have created.
All of these things are referred to as Resale.

(c) You may reproduce the Product:
in a printed format or;
on a website or;
in an electronic document such as a PowerPoint presentation or an ebook or;
as part of software you create or;
in a video production or;
in a music track;

(d) Your use of the Product is limited to a single application.

(e) You may use the Product in a work which you are creating for your own
purposes or for your client who has asked you to create it.

(f) You may incorporate the Product in a work which is created for Resale by you
or your client (provided that only the complete work is offered for sale and the
terms of sale (i) require those that acquire the work to only use the Product
for their own personal use or in a work they are creating for a client (ii)
prohibit resale of the Product as a stand-alone item).

(g) You may display the Product, and make the Product available for use by an
unlimited number of your clients, in conjunction with a web site service that
you host on behalf of your clients. When using the Product through a web site
service, you may make unlimited copies of the Product but you must procure that
your clients do not reproduce or use the Product in another application.

(h) If the Product is used or incorporated in a work there is no restriction on
the number of copies of that work that can be reproduced and distributed.

(i) Notwithstanding the restriction on Resale, if you acquire the Product on
behalf of your client you may recoup from your client the cost of acquiring the
Product.

For example: you may incorporate the Product, such as a music file, in a sound
mixing software program that you or your client distributes commercially. An
unlimited number of copies of the software program may be made and sold but the
Product cannot be incorporated in more than one software program or other work.
Additionally, buyers of the software program must not offer the Product (that is
the music file) for sale, such as on a site like AudioJungle.
