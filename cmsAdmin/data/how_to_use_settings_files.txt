HOW TO USE MULTIPLE SETTINGS FILES
-------------------------------------

If you run the software on both a development and a live server, you can create a
copy of settings.dat.php for your development environment by naming it after
the hostname of your development server (typically localhost).

For example, if you create a copy called settings.localhost.php, the software
will use that file when it's running on localhost, but default to
settings.dat.php when it runs anywhere else.

This functionality is especially useful for supplying separate MySQL details.
Once you have this set up, you won't have to worry about overwriting the "wrong
version" of a settings file; you can safely upload and download both files with
FTP and the correct one will be used on each server.

Note: Only ever use custom settings files for development servers, always use
the default file for your "live" or production server.  That way if you live
domain name changes things won't break.
