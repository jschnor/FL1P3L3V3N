                <h5 class="subheader">Website Strategy, Design & Development</h5>
                <p>Founded by Chris and Carla Sloan, 2C Media is a passion-driven creative production company that creates award winning work – earning them over 12 PromaxBDA Awards in the past five years. The Miami-based creative company has built their business on creating promotions and original-content.</p>

                <p>Currently, 2C Media is going through a rebrand that will include a redesign of their existing website. They desire a website that competes with similar creative production companies, but separates 2C by highlighting both why they do what they do as well as what they do. They also request that the technology for the new site be more future-proof than the previous flash-based website.</p>
                <p>2C Media has engaged with Flipeleven Creative to design, develop and guide 2C Media on the creation of their new website. To date, Flipeleven and 2C Media have exchanged e-mails and conference calls to discuss the details of the project.</p>

                <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
                <p>Flipeleven proposes a three-phase process to launch 2C Media's new website. It will start with a collaboration on the website strategy. Then move into Phase II where Flipeleven will prototype the website while creating design concepts as 2C Media collects and creates content. The final phase will wrap with Flipeleven's development team combining content, designs and prototypes to a staging link for quality assurance testing before the final website launch.</p>

                <h3>Phase I</h3>
                <h4>Website Strategy</h4>
                <p>Flipelven would lead brainstorms, discussions and/or in-person meetings with 2C Media to both determine a content structure and ideate over a creative direction for the website. This is a foundational step in determining a technical solution that will remain valuable over time. This collaboration helps us to determine exact project scope for the following two phases.</p>

                  <h3>Changes To The Scope Of Work</h3>
                  <p>Revisions or author’s alterations to the Scope of Work shall obligate the Client to additional fees and costs. These may include but are not limited to: changes made to copy after the final copy has been submitted; changes made to the design once layouts, website design, or site map have been approved; extensive alterations; a change in marketing objectives on the part of the Client and new work requested by the Client after the execution of the Agreement. All production costs are based on the assumption that copy will be provided electronically. Change orders will be prepared by Flipeleven LLC and provided to the Client outlining the changes to the Scope of Work, and any additional costs for those changes. The Client agrees to pay Flipeleven LLC additional fees and costs for said revisions or alterations at a rate of $100.00 per hour. Hourly rates quoted in proposals will remain in effect until further written notice is given. If Flipeleven LLC is unable to meet the delivery schedule set forth in the Agreement due to delays by Client or changes requested by Client in the Scope of Work, Flipeleven LLC may, in its discretion, revise the production schedule as necessary and provide for adjustments in the costs for the Project.</p>

                  <h3>Overtime/Rush Charges</h3>
                  <p>Estimates are based on normal and reasonable time schedules, and may have to be revised to take into consideration any “rush” requests requiring overtime or weekends. Knowledge of Client’s deadline is essential to provide an accurate estimate of costs. Flipeleven LLC overtime incurred at the Client’s request will be billed at a rate of $150.00 per hour. The Client will also be responsible for additional charges imposed by outside suppliers, such as pre-press or printers, to meet Client’s “rush” requests. To the extent possible, Flipeleven LLC will advise Client of all situations that require overtime and/or rush charges, and the amount of additional compensation that will be charged to meet such overtime requirements or rush requests. Rush or overtime fees may be incurred if the Client does not meet approval or content deadlines, which have been established to meet the Client’s desired schedule.</p>
